# Creative Hack Lab: Assignment

Module Leader: rob.canning@coventry.ac.uk 

## Summary:

Create a multi-element Networked Media Campaign which engages with a real-world  contemporary political debate regarding our interactions within the Internet. 

The results of this live brief will be installed/distributed/broadcast in a public space so should be engaging and informative to a non-expert, general audience. 

Emphasis will be placed on creative play while incorporating industry best practices. The module shall be run in the style of a hackathon and will incorporate elements of the Agile Scrum methodology.

In this work you are expected to collaborate to fuse theoretical, contextual, practical and creative elements into a coherent set of outputs.

## Group Project: Four Groups of Four.

Groups shall be determined by a  randomising computer script.

## Technical Support:

While you will receive technical guidance, in this module an emphasis is place on self-directed and peer-assisted learning. A list of resources is provided in the links section of this document.

### Choose from one of the below topics:

1.	The free and open Internet.
2.	A brief history of Hactivism.
3.	Big Data, Open Data.
4.	Strong Encryption, Cypherpunks and Society.
5.	The methods and ethics of GCHQ surveillance.
6.	The TTIP Debate and its implications for you.
7.	The DRIPA debate in the UK and its implications you.

You must submit all the five refelctive journal posts and a minimum of 4 of the below elements (as .pdf file over Moodle/Turnit-in using the HAND-IN sheet):
(including at least one from each of A and B sections – it is also possible to choose more than one element from section 5.)

## A:

1.	A Poster / Infographic / Leaflet  - Must be made using Inskcape, GIMP, Scribus, LibreOffice. This should incorporate both RFID and QR-Code augmentation.

2.	A Podcast 5-10mins, a short radio podcast in which you highlight some of the issues around your topic as a commentary, interview, talking heads or combination of those elements – combined with music, intro/outro etc. – with RSS feed. Create using Audacity and output as high-quality lossy formats Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) and Opus (.opus) as well as lossless FLAC (.flac).

3.	Interactive Processing Sketch (Fullscreen Mode) to one or more screens: https://processing.org/reference/fullScreen_.html

4.	3D Animated Poster/Inforgraphic  using Blender (rendered out as  a 1920x1080 video: mpeg4 x264, .ogv and webm codecs).

## B:

5.	A Network Service – Webpage, Wordpress, Asterisk VOIP server, Diaspora Pod etc., Icecast streaming server, Airtime Radio Server, looping Video/Audio playback script, Python based Twitter bot. (This can be as simple as a webpage to host some media related to the project or a more complex/ambitious combination of any of the above)


6.	One or more Raspberry Pi computers to host/playback the above service/media/scripts. https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-video-looper/overview

7.	Arduino-based,  motion activated element to trigger any of the above media elements. (eg. http://makezine.com/2012/10/22/a-halloween-sound-trigger-with-raspberry-pi-and-arduino/)



All elements must observe design consistency. For example logos, fonts choices, colour palates etc. should be shared and used project wide. A design specification sheet should be uploaded to the github repository.

In this assignment you must use only use free and open source software. 
The requirements for this assignment are easily achievable using the software tools mentioned above. In forcing you our of your tool-chain comfort zone you will learn: the importance of transferable skills, the context of open-source tools in industry, freelance work and society.
	Submission:
Projects will be displayed as a public exhibition and will be assessed in this context.

All code/text  based  elements of the work must be version controlled using Git and the URL to your projects code must be public displayed as part of your exhibition display.

There must be a README.md file in your Github repository where you attribute the individual elements of the work (i.e. an explanation of who did what within the group).

A link to a digital copy of all your work (code, media assets, project files, documentation) must be uploaded to Turnitin.
